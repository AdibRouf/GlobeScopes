# GlobeScopes
Analyze words located in various media news headlines to create a word cloud.

One of the first projects I decided to make after learning python was a program that could go search for something and provide information about it. So, I created a mini project, GlobeScopes, which in short takes a user input and tries to find data on the input provided from news headlines.
